## About Me <a name="about-me"></a>

Hey, there! ðŸŒŸ I'm Tshepiso, a junior web developer with creativity, enthusiasm, and a diverse background. I hold a Master's in Human Genetics from the University of Cape Town (UCT) and a B.Tech in Biomedical Technology from the University of Johannesburg (UJ). I bring the precision of a scientist and the imagination of an artist to the world of web development!

Before diving into the captivating world of code, I worked as a Procurement Manager at Procter and Gamble (P&G). From managing budgets to problem-solving, I honed my leadership and communication skills.

Now, I've taken flight in the tech universe, and I'm on a learning spree with Udemy courses, leveling up my skills and exploring the latest web development trends. I love innovation and thrive in dynamic and collaborative spaces.
